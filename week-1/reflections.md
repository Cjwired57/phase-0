1.1 Think About Time Reflection
The time management/productivity ideas that I focused on were the concepts of Time Boxing and Flow. Time Boxing refers to placing time boundaries around an action or activity (project, meeting, anything really), resulting in a greater focus on the value delivered. I also looked into where Time Boxing fits into the agile methodology of software development. Agile teams prefer to Time Box their projects since the resulting focus on value ensures that the team is building the most valuable work as soon as possible…starting with the most critical tasks and leaving the less critical ones to the end. While some requirements might not get implemented, it ensures that what does actually get developed is the most essential of the required features.

I’ve honestly put very little time into exploring different productivity strategies and my own have been fairly freeform over the past 5 years. I definitely have certain patterns that I implement to get into a state of flow (identifying morning hours as my most productive state, coffee, to do lists), but there were definitely times that I ran out of time and would take extensions rather than delivering a minimum viable product (be it a paper or a project) on time. I definitely plan on implementing time boxing to Phase 0 by 1) going through the week’s module ahead of time and identifying which tasks will be the most challenging/require the most time and drawing up a daily schedule for the week that accounts for these more critical tasks.

1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. What is a shell? What is “bash?”

A shell is just the UI used to access a computer’s operating system, also known as a command language interpreter. Bash is the shell for the GNU operating system.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I thought that piping/redirection was a bit confusing at first, but got the hang of it after running through the exercises and playing around with it on my own.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yep, successfully used all of them.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

The “man” and “help” commands are probably the most important since it contains the descriptions of every other command at your disposal. Other than that, I think that the “*” tool is incredibly helpful in streamlining your work and had a lot of fun playing around with it.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does off the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd: Stands for “print working directory”, it shows you what directory you are in.

ls: “list directory” lists all of the directories inside your working directory.

mv: For moving a file or directory…really more like renaming

cd: “change directory”, lets you hop from one directory to another.

../: Another way to change directories, each “..” will send you back one directory.

touch: makes a new empty file

mkdir: “make directory”, pretty simple, this command makes a directory or folder

less: when reading a file, the less command will let you view that file and page through it

rmdir: “remove directory”, let’s you remove directories (they have to be empty though)

rm: This command lets you remove files.

help: Brings you to a menu with a list of commands
