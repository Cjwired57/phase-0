Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
You would create a repository by going to github, selecting create new and then repository.  After filling out the repository name, description, and setting the license to MIT, you are good to create your repository.  Then you would go onto your computer's command line and use the command git clone <URL>, which would allow you to use your repository's URL to clone it.
Describe what open source means.
Open source denotes any software where the original source code is made freely available for the public to redistribute and modify as they see fit.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I love Open Source...as long as people are careful with sensitive code/information.  It is truly amazing that so much information is out there for free, for example, all of wikipedia is technically open source.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important in allowing software to be freely changed and shared since copyright is automatic in the U.S.
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Everything went pretty straight forward, but I definitely got more practice through the repitition of creating a new repository, cloning it, and going through the add/commit steps.
