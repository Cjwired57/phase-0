      -What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
      Everything was fairly straightforward as the site was pretty simple, really helped solidify everything we went over though.

      -How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
      I used w3schools as a database of semantic elements which was a very helpful resource.
      -How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
      We were able to stick to the best practices well enough and didn't run into any problems when we validated our HTML.
      -What seems good and bad about HTML?
      I think one good thing about HTML is how light it is on the code...CMS websites can be code heavy which can sometimes lead to a slower load speed.  HTML is also useful because other languages are easily added to the website, as I'm sure we'll discover next week.
      -What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
      No tricks other than memorization!
