Reflections:


**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**
The inspector allows you to change your different divs and alter them with any element, but is incredibly helpful in that it simultaneously allows you to visualize these changes.  By unmarking certain elements/dimensions, you can see exactly what effect each piece of css code has on the final product.


**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**
You can resize elements with height and width dimensions, either using pixels or ems.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning?  Which did you find easiest to use?  Which was most difficult?**
Static is the default, relative positioning sets elements according to positioning attributes, for example if you have bottom: 20px it will shift position 20px up.  Elements with absolute positioning are not affected by other elements and vice versa, they don't affect other elements.  Finally, fixed positioning fixes an element in a window or browser, like many sites' footers or headers, when you scroll up or down they will stay in the same place.


**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**The border basically sets the boundaries of your element or box.  The margin dictates how the box/element behaves around other boxes/elements, basically setting the space between the border and other boxes/elements.  The padding determines how far away the content in the box will be from the boxes borders.


**What was your impression of this challenge overall?**
At first the challenge was incredibly frustrating, we just could not figure out why a lot of these boxes were behaving so strangely with eachother even when we eliminated a lot of the elements...eventually we got the hang of it through process of elimination and it helped me get a better sense for exactly how different boxes with different positioning values interact with each other.
